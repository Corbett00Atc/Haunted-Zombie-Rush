Got the transition between states going
but need to find a better way to make the
zombie spawn correctly. He spawns in right position
and falls down without hitting the obstacles.

- I solved this by freezing the zombie locations and
removing all velocity and rotations.
- I solved this by enabling detectCollisions again
